# Akan Name Generator

## Project Description
The Akan Name Generator is a simple web application that allows users to discover their Akan name based on their birthdate and gender. Akan names originate from Ghanaian culture, where children are traditionally named according to the day of the week they were born.

The application calculates the day of the week from the user’s birthdate and assigns the correct Akan name based on the selected gender.
